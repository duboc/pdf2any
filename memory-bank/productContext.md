# Product Context: PDF Data Extractor & Reconciler

## 1. Problem Solved

Manually extracting specific information from PDF documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially when dealing with numerous files. Automating this process can save significant time and improve data accuracy. However, relying on a single extraction method (either purely programmatic/OSS or purely AI-driven) might not always yield the best results due to variations in PDF structures, quality, and the complexities of natural language understanding. Programmatic methods might struggle with complex layouts or scanned documents, while AI might occasionally misinterpret context or hallucinate data.

This application aims to address these challenges by:
*   Automating the extraction process entirely.
*   Leveraging the strengths of both traditional programming libraries (for potentially structured data) and advanced AI (for unstructured data and complex interpretation).
*   Introducing a reconciliation step using AI to compare, validate, and merge the results from both methods, aiming for higher accuracy and reliability than either method alone.
*   Providing a user-friendly web interface for easy file submission.
*   Delivering the final, cleaned data in a standard, usable format (Excel).

## 2. Target User & Use Case

The target user is likely someone who regularly needs to extract specific, structured, or semi-structured data points from a batch of PDF documents (e.g., invoices, reports, forms) and consolidate this information into a spreadsheet for analysis, reporting, or further processing. They need a reliable and automated way to do this without manual intervention for each file.

## 3. Desired User Experience

*   **Simple Upload:** The user should easily be able to select one or more PDF files through a web browser interface and initiate the process with a single click.
*   **Clear Feedback:** The interface should provide feedback on the process status (e.g., "Uploading...", "Processing...", "Reconciling...", "Generating Report...", "Complete/Error").
*   **Accessible Output:** Once processing is complete, the user should be able to easily download the generated Excel file containing the extracted and reconciled data.
*   **Reliability:** The process should be robust, handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., invalid PDF, extraction failure), and provide informative messages if issues occur.

## 4. Success Metrics (Potential)

*   Reduction in time spent manually extracting data.
*   Improved accuracy of extracted data compared to manual methods or single-method automation.
*   User satisfaction with the ease of use and reliability of the tool.
*   Successful processing rate of uploaded PDFs.
